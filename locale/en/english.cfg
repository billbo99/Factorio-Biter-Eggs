[mod-setting-description]
biters-per-large-egg-nest-min=Minimum number of biters/spitters that come out of a large egg nest when destroyed. Each nest is randomly biter/spitter, the enemies are evolution level dependant and will be a random number between min and max settings.
biters-per-large-egg-nest-ax=Maximum number of biters/spitters that come out of a large egg nest when destroyed. Each nest is randomly biter/spitter, the enemies are evolution level dependant and will be a random number between min and max settings.
biters-per-small-egg-nest-min=Minimum number of biters/spitters that come out of a small egg nest when destroyed. Each nest is randomly biter/spitter, the enemies are evolution level dependant and will be a random number between min and max settings.
biters-per-small-egg-nest-ax=Maximum number of biters/spitters that come out of a small egg nest when destroyed. Each nest is randomly biter/spitter, the enemies are evolution level dependant and will be a random number between min and max settings.
egg-nest-quantity=The frequency of egg nests on the map. 0 = none, 2 = some (default), 10 = everywhere, 100 = ridiculous
