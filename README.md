# Factorio-Biter-Eggs

Adds biter egg nests to the map in addition to normal biter bases. When destroyed they will release evolution appropriate biters/spitters.

The biter egg nests can have their frequency set with a simple mod setting, ranging from rare to everywhere.

When a biter egg nest is destroyed a configurable range of either biters or spitters will be released. Each egg nest is either all biters or spitters. The enemy type will be evolution appropriate and match biter/spitter spawner configurations.

Thanks to Hornwitser for some egg nest graphics.


Todo/Experimenting With
------------
 - When spawner dies it becomes a dead spawner with eggs, effectively a large egg nest.
 - See if the noise generation can be used nicely with the ingame sliders. Initial testing not successful.
