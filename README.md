# Factorio-Biter-Eggs

Adds a configurable number of biter egg nests to the map. When detroyed they will release a configured number of evolution approperiate biters/spitters.

!!!GIF HERE!!!

The biter egg nests can have their frequency set with a simple mod setting, ranging from rare to everywhere.
When a biter egg nest is destroyed a configurable number of either biters or spitters will be released. Each egg nest is either all biters or spitters. The biters will be randomly selected based on the ingame evolution level, just as regular biter spawners.


--Todo:
 - Complete the spawner dieing to be dead spawner with eggs. Just temp image made.
 - See if the noise generation can be used nicely with the ingame sliders. Initial testing not successful.
